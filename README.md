# This is a library management system. This system is designed by GUI using the knowledge of C#.

In this system, there have some conditions which are followed here strictly. 
    1. To get the library services, a new user must register the system and if someone is already registered in the system, they can easily login into the system. 
    2. This system has 3 types of users (Student, Admin, Librarian) who can get access by the system. 
    3. If a regular or a new user login in to the system, they will see the user home page where they can borrow the books, search their favorite books, and also see their profile. 
    4. If an admin or librarian login into the system, they will go to the individual page. For admin, it will be Admin Page and for the librarian, it will be Librarian Page. 
    5. After that, they can easily do all the maintenance things from their page like add/remove books, books update, add/remove user, update user information, search and update the book, issue and return books but an admin has more power because he/she can add librarian and also can add or remove admin where a librarian cannot do this thing. 
    6. Lastly, all the records will be stored in the database for safety and when it is needed for the edit, it will be easier to update, remove and insert.

Though this is the online app, so it will be great to readers can read a book whenever he/she wants. This app is so simple and easy to operate. Through this app, we can increase librarianâ€™s efficiencies. So, there will be some functionality errors but we are hopeful that our app will be beneficial to a user.
